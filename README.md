# Ukrainian Migration Information Practices and Experiences
In February 2022, Ukraine experienced a significant military conflict following Russia’s invasion, marking the most severe crisis in Central Europe since 1945. By mid-May 2022, a large number of civilians had lost their lives, suffered injuries, and millions were displaced within the country or had sought refuge in other European nations. In situations of war migration, gathering trustworthy information is challenging; unreliable and trustful information is abundant and politically biased, complicating migrants’ decisions on what and whom to trust. This study aims to understand the practices and experiences of shock migrants with information by mapping the types and sources of information and comprehending migrants’ information evaluation processes. A snowball, non-probability sampling technique was used for online survey data collection among migrants, published from April 15 to May 24, 2023. Study findings are limited in representativeness, time, and data collection location. However, results highlight that survey respondents mostly live in Romania, are highly educated, bilingual in Russian and Ukrainian, and left in the first two months of the war's outbreak. Findings suggest that information resilience plays a crucial role in shock migrants’ journeys through the impact of trustworthy information, social capital, and migrants’ agency. The study concludes by proposing a series of recommendations for the field of information communication in times of war. Future research is needed to further understand migrants’ information practices and experiences, specifically in times of war.
